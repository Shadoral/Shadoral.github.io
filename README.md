<h1>
    Introduction
</h1>
<p> 
I hope to share what i know about the subject that i am passionate in. This is my contribution, an attempt at providing educational resources about chemistry. I have been fortunate enough to have met people who guided and pointed me in a favourable direction (le chatelier principle LOL ok pun aside). This is my method of paying it forward by immortalising somewhat of a knowledge/library thing on the internet.
