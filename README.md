    Introduction
</h1>
<p> 
I hope to share what i know about the subject that i am passionate in. This is my contribution, an attempt at providing educational resources about chemistry. I have been fortunate enough to have met people who guided and pointed me in a favourable direction (le chatelier principle LOL ok pun aside). This is my method of paying it forward by immortalising somewhat of a knowledge/library thing on the internet.

   Do you want a career in chemistry? 
</h2>
<p>
     before diving into books i'd recommend, lets address the elephant in the room. Do you want a career in chemistry? Chances are you have interest and thoughts about reading chemistry as a major and possibly a career in the respective field after you graduate. Now imagine yourself working in a lab alone, running test for your samples for six hour straight and then reporting the data/results to your superiors. How does that make you feel? What i have just described would most likely be your job scope in a analytical chemist role other than some ad-hoc matters. If you think you are fine with it, i would think you are comfortable in a lab/love the task and this might even be your dream job. 
   </p>  
<p>
     Note that i have simplified this job scope and your responsibilities may differ but it should not be a lot different unless your job requires you to go on-site or discuss legal matters or research and development (R&D) role.
To my knowledge in my country's market it is pretty much analytical chemist role in demand.
</p>
<p>
I have heard instances where students love the theory component of chemistry and relatively short lab hours throughout their undergrad years but when it comes to real life job they dread it as it is routine-based and has little flexiblity, and few years into their job post they decide to switch industries/get into a cushy lecturer job but there's only so many of such post.
