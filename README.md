<h1>
    Introduction
</h1>
<p> 
I hope to share what i know about the subject that i am passionate in. This is my contribution, an attempt at providing educational resources about chemistry. I have been fortunate enough to have met people who guided and pointed me in a favourable direction (le chatelier principle LOL ok pun aside). This is my method of paying it forward by immortalising somewhat of a knowledge/library thing on the internet. 

<h2>
   Do you want a career in chemistry? 
</h2>
<p>
  Before diving into the books I'd recommend, let's address the elephant in the room: Do you want a career in chemistry? Chances are you have an interest in majoring in chemistry and possibly pursuing a career in the field after you graduate. Now, imagine yourself working alone in a lab, running tests on your samples for six hours straight, and then reporting the results to your superiors. How does that make you feel? What I have just described is likely what your job as an analytical chemist would entail, aside from some ad-hoc tasks. If you think you are fine with this, you probably enjoy lab work and might even find this to be your dream job. 
</p>
<p>
Note that I have simplified the job scope, and your responsibilities may vary, but they shouldn't be too different unless your job requires you to go on-site, discuss legal matters, or engage in research and development (R&D). From my knowledge of my country's market, the role of an analytical chemist is in high demand.
</p>
<p>
I have heard of instances where students love the theoretical components of chemistry and the relatively short lab hours during their undergraduate years. However, when it comes to a real-life job, they dread it because it is routine-based and lacks flexibility. A few years into their career, they decide to switch industries or seek a cushy lecturer position, but there are only so many of those roles available.

</p>
<h2>
   Why i chose chemistry
</h2>
<p>
     Oddly enough, I couldn't think of a proper answer off the top of my head. As I grew older, my answers became a blurâ€”life happened. I had to revisit my past self. In the past, I wrote down some personal statements. In them, I 
     mentioned, "Since I was young, I wanted to contribute and apply what I love and know to the advancement of sciences and the chemical industry," and, "The dream of becoming a scientist was something I longed for, as I loved the idea of
     tackling socio-technological problems relevant to the current and future of our world." The eagerness and belief in doing good with science struck a chord with me, which I believe is why, when "Oppenheimer" was released in cinemas, I
     became a huge fan of him and studied what transpired in the past.
</p>
<p>
     While I am not as naive as I once was, I still believe science is the only viable career option for me. I was offered the chance to pursue chemical engineering and materials science as majors; however, I decided to decline both of 
     them because I wanted to pursue natural science in a theoretical manner rather than applied science practically. Reading the course outlines helped me reach this decision, and I don't think I can learn effectively by only knowing the 
     broad applications of chemistry. My desire is to understand chemistry and perhaps even come up with theoretical approaches to solving chemistry problems, such as using computational methods.
</p>
<p>
     Another question to ask yourself is: Are you able to picture yourself as a finance/tech bro working in an office? I couldn't. I don't think those careers would fulfill me.
