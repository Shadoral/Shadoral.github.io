<h1>
    Introduction
</h1>
<p> 
I hope to share what i know about the subject that i am passionate in. This is my contribution, an attempt at providing educational resources about chemistry. I have been fortunate enough to have met people who guided and pointed me in a favourable direction (le chatelier principle LOL ok pun aside). This is my method of paying it forward by immortalising somewhat of a knowledge/library thing on the internet. 

<h2>
   Do you want a career in chemistry? 
</h2>
<p>
  Before diving into the books I'd recommend, let's address the elephant in the room: Do you want a career in chemistry? Chances are you have an interest in majoring in chemistry and possibly pursuing a career in the field after you graduate. Now, imagine yourself working alone in a lab, running tests on your samples for six hours straight, and then reporting the results to your superiors. How does that make you feel? What I have just described is likely what your job as an analytical chemist would entail, aside from some ad-hoc tasks. If you think you are fine with this, you probably enjoy lab work and might even find this to be your dream job. 
</p>
<p>
Note that I have simplified the job scope, and your responsibilities may vary, but they shouldn't be too different unless your job requires you to go on-site, discuss legal matters, or engage in research and development (R&D). From my knowledge of my country's market, the role of an analytical chemist is in high demand.
</p>
<p>
I have heard of instances where students love the theoretical components of chemistry and the relatively short lab hours during their undergraduate years. However, when it comes to a real-life job, they dread it because it is routine-based and lacks flexibility. A few years into their career, they decide to switch industries or seek a cushy lecturer position, but there are only so many of those roles available.
