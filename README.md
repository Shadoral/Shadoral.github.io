<h1>
    Introduction
</h1>
<p> 
I hope to share what i know about the subject that i am passionate in. This is my contribution, an attempt at providing educational resources about chemistry. I have been fortunate enough to have met people who guided and pointed me in a favourable direction (le chatelier principle LOL ok pun aside). This is my method of paying it forward by immortalising somewhat of a knowledge/library thing on the internet. 

<h2>
   Do you want a career in chemistry? 
</h2>
<p>
  Before diving into the books I'd recommend, let's address the elephant in the room: Do you want a career in chemistry? Chances are you have an interest in majoring in chemistry and possibly pursuing a career in the field after you graduate. Now, imagine yourself working alone in a lab, running tests on your samples for six hours straight, and then reporting the results to your superiors. How does that make you feel? What I have just described is likely what your job as an analytical chemist would entail, aside from some ad-hoc tasks. If you think you are fine with this, you probably enjoy lab work and might even find this to be your dream job. 
</p>
<p>
Note that I have simplified the job scope, and your responsibilities may vary, but they shouldn't be too different unless your job requires you to go on-site, discuss legal matters, or engage in research and development (R&D). From my knowledge of my country's market, the role of an analytical chemist is in high demand.
</p>
<p>
I have heard of instances where students love the theoretical components of chemistry and the relatively short lab hours during their undergraduate years. However, when it comes to a real-life job, they dread it because it is routine-based and lacks flexibility. A few years into their career, they decide to switch industries or seek a cushy lecturer position, but there are only so many of those roles available. There are a lot of factors to consider, such as financial/desire/lifestyle. 
<p>
     My advice to picking something is think about what career you don't like/most likely wont enjoy and strike those career off the list. Nobody can stop you from learning and thinking about your future 
     The real issue is where you want to work. It's possible to switch from one discipline to another but it's not easy, So, it's wise to decide which job suits you best.
</p>
<p>
To decide, you need to know how jobs differ. For this, it's best to talk to as people as you can, and find out what their jobs are like. Talk to your professors!
</p>
<p>
     Understandbly not everyone is fortunate enough to have choices and i wish you all the best don't give up.

<h2>
   Why i chose chemistry
</h2>
<p>
     Oddly enough, I couldn't think of a proper answer off the top of my head. As I grew older, my answers became a blurâ€”life happened. I had to revisit my past self. In the past, I wrote down some personal statements. In them, I 
     mentioned, "Since I was young, I wanted to contribute and apply what I love and know to the advancement of sciences and the chemical industry," and, "The dream of becoming a scientist was something I longed for, as I loved the idea of
     tackling socio-technological problems relevant to the current and future of our world." The eagerness and belief in doing good with science struck a chord with me, which I believe is why, when "Oppenheimer" was released in cinemas, I
     became a huge fan of him and studied what transpired in the past. 
     </p>
<p>
     During my secondary school years, i enrolled early into a 3 years chemistry course in a polytechnic because i loved chemistry so much to the point my youtube feed was filled with codylab/styropyro/nilered's video as recommendation.
     They certainly did helped supplement my interest in the subject :) kudos to them! After graduating my next course of action was to apply for a university course. Side note, it was also when i was at polytechnic where i met most of my influential figures in my life. Not only that but also the elective modules i have taken helped me understand chemistry from a different pov such as math and physics.
</p>
<p>
     While I am not as naive as I once was, I still believe science is the only viable career option for me. I was offered the chance to pursue chemical engineering and materials science as majors; however, I decided to decline both of 
     them because I wanted to pursue natural science in a theoretical manner rather than applied science practically. Reading the course outlines helped me reach this decision, and I don't think I can learn effectively by only knowing the 
     broad applications of chemistry. My desire is to understand chemistry and perhaps even come up with theoretical approaches to solving chemistry problems, such as using computational methods. If i am eligible to apply for post graduate studies i will attempt to finish the PhD at my local university. Right now i will just do my best to learn whatever i can. :) 
</p>
<p>
     Another question to ask yourself is: Are you able to picture yourself as a finance/tech bro working in an office? I couldn't. I don't think those careers would fulfill me.

<h2>
   Mindset/Mentality that i think would benefit you as a scientist 
</h2>
     <li>Being observant</li>
     <li>Being curious</li>
     <li>Being open-minded</li>
     <li>Open communication</li>
     <li>Take risk</li>
     <li> learn to?keep yourself sane</li>

<p>
     In the midst of writing, i was informed that the voice actress of Nobita from Doraemon a childhood anime of mine has passed. While i have stopped watching it, it was what got me interested in science in the first place and it was also the first science fiction medium to introduce time travel to me. I hope many more mediums will continue to inspire future generation scientist just as this one did for me. RIP. Bless you reader and take care.
